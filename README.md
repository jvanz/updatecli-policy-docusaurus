# README

This repository is an experimentation leveraging https://github.com/updatecli/updatecli/releases/tag/v0.63.0
To maintain shareable Updatecli policies that can be used from their own repository.

Today each docusaurus website has its own set of duplicated policies which become harder to maintain over time.

Running `make help` list all common tasks with this repository

## Requirements

* [Updatecli](https://www.updatecli.io/docs/prologue/installation/) version 0.63.0
* Makefile

## Release

Push a git tag matching the version of the Policy defined by the field "version" in policy/Policy.yaml

## Contributing

Feel free to:
* report any Updatecli bugs on https://github.com/updatecli/updatecli
* start discussion about potential Updatecli workflow on https://github.com/orgs/updatecli/discussions
